The world today generates terabytes of data from many sources. Millions of tweets, Facebook
updates and emails are sent each day. Millions of transactions occur in the financial and retail sector every hour. How do we make use of this vast amount of data to the benefit of business? How do you present the information to the management in an easy to use format? For decades, many IT managers have relied on the big software corporations to provide them with the business intelligence software that can help with the task of generating and presenting the required reports and performing data analytics. Fast forward to this last decade, it is not only the big businesses that generate vast amounts of data but also small startups that have online presence.

 A web startup might require business intelligence software to make sense of customers that visit their web site. Traditional business intelligence software does not come cheap and before the advent of the open source software, it was almost impossible for businesses with small budgets to afford BI software.

Thankfully, the open source community has produced wonderful business intelligence software
which is easy to use and ready for production. Knowage is a business intelligence software from
Italy which is licensed under the Affero GPL v3 and supports all the components of business intelligence such as OLAP, dash boards, reports and charts. Knowage comes in two versions; Community Edition and Enterprise Edition. We will be using the Community Edition.

According to the online encyclopedia Wikipedia, Business Intelligence refers to computer-based
techniques used in identifying, extracting and analyzing business data, such as sales revenue by
products and/or departments, or by associated costs and incomes. Business Intelligence
technologies provide historical, current and predictive views of business operations. Common functions of business intelligence technologies are reporting, online analytical processing, analytics, data mining, process mining, complex event processing, business performance management, benchmarking, text mining and predictive analytics.

Business Intelligence systems are very important for decision making and sometimes they are
referred to as decision support systems. To put this in perspective, assume you are the CEO of a
large bank. Which kind of information would you like to know about your bank at any given
time? You might want to know how many account holders are in a certain age group, for
example so as to make a decision on which products best suits them or you may want to know
how much you spend to acquire a customer. Naturally, you always want to know what your
competitor is doing. This is in a branch of Business Intelligence called Competitive Intelligence.
